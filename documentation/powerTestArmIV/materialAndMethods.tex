\subsection{Test description}
The test aims to provide an estimate of the power consumption during normal use. The depth of the cultvator is adjusted to 1.5 cm relative to the front wheels, see figure \ref{fig:vibro_crop_working_depth}. Due to the fact that the front wheels also dig into the ground, the working depth will be around 2-3 cm \cite{vibro_crop}. The Armadillo IV will be driven a distance of 10 m \todo{specific number of times}several times. The power consumption will be measured during each run, using the Turnigy watt meter and an external camera.

The test will be conducted on a piece of field that hasn't previously be been processed. Driving on previously processed land would provide soil that is easier to drag the cultivator through and thereby produce a lower power consumption than on unprocessed land. 

The motor controllers include a way for measuring of the power consumption. This data can be accessed through ROS bag. The tests will also be used to see in the internal power measuring will produce results similar to the Turnigy wattmeter.
