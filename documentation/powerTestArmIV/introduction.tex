\section{Introduction}


A major key factor in developing a battery pack is the electrical specifications. 


The outcome of this test is divided into two parts. First of all it will determine the power consumption and current drained from the batteries. Second, comparison between between the power analyzer and the data collected in a rosbag from the RoboteQ will determine if the controllers data are reliable. In case of the data from the RoboteQ controllers are reliable, then data from previous trials can be used to improve the estimation of energy consumption and electrical specifications. Else the data from the power analyzer must be used, but with expectations of a greater error.
